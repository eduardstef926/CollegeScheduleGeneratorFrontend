## Project Title: ScheduleGenerator

## Description

ScheduleGenerator is a web application built on frontend with React.js and Next.js. 
It helps users to create schedules by taking into account various factors such as available rooms, 
student enrollment, and professor availability. Additionally, users can view a schedule list
for the available institutions under the "View Schedule" tab. For backend, .NET was used and the
architecture is split into 3 microservices. As for the database, regular SQL is used and .NET libraries
like Entity Framework were very helpful.

## Completed Functionalities:
  1. Basic view structure for tables and schedules
  2. Login Page

## Future Improvements:
  1. Utilize server-side rendering and browser caching for loading time
  2. Add a resource manager for code text
  3. Utilize a client secret approach for logging
